For this assignment, write a C# program that has several simple functions:

DisplayWelcome - Displays the message, "Welcome to the Program!".

PromptUserName - Asks for and returns the user's name (as a string).

PromptUserNumber - Asks for and returns the user's favorite number (as an integer).

SquareNumber - Accepts an integer as a parameter and returns that number squared (as an integer).
