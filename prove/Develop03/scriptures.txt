Helam√°n 5:12|And now, remember, my children, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that you must establish your foundation, so that when the devil throws his mighty winds, yes, his darts at the whirlwind, yea, when all its hail and furious storm lashes you, this has no power to drag you down into the abyss of misery and endless anguish, because of the rock on which you are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation on which you are built. which, if men build, they shall not fall.
